- **Security advisory monitoring** with real-time alerts
- **Project metrics collection** with trend analysis

## 🎛️ Automation Intelligence

### Smart Labeling System
Automated labels based on content analysis:
- **Priority**: `low`, `medium`, `high` (based on keywords and impact)
- **Type**: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `question`, `performance`
- **Component**: `build`, `ui`, `server`, `events` (based on file changes)
- **Status**: `draft`, `ready-for-review`, `stale`, `resolved`

### Intelligent Assignment
- **Maintainer assignment** based on expertise areas (security, performance, UI)
- **Reviewer assignment** based on file changes and CODEOWNERS
- **Community contributor** identification and welcome automation

### Performance Optimization
- **Smart caching** for cargo registry and build artifacts
- **Parallel job execution** where possible to reduce CI time
- **Conditional execution** to avoid unnecessary work
- **Resource optimization** with appropriate runner selection

## 📈 Expected Benefits

### Development Velocity
